# Next Word Predictor
A Natural Language Processing R&D project   
Developed by Herbert Barrientos   

## **DESCRIPTION**   
The project is composed of three parts:   
  1. An R program that captures raw source data from three sources, performs data cleaning, and transforms the resulting tidy data into n-gram data files.   
  2. A next-word prediction algorithm that uses the produced n-gram data files for textual input processing.   
  3. A Shiny Apps application used to test the prediction algorithm online.
